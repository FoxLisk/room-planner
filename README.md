# What it is:

I couldn't find a half-decent apartment planner online, so I made one that is
not very sophisticated but suits my needs. The idea is that you can draw
arbitrary walls according to the actual layout of your home, and then move
furniture around within them. The basic usage is to draw walls first, then add
objects (furniture), then position the furniture like it is in your home now,
and then save that configuration. Then you can move furniture around to your
heart's content, save as many configurations as you want, restore to your old
configurations to decide between, etc.

Everything is done locally - the whole project is 1 HTML file, 1 CSS file and 1
JavaScript file. All the state is saved locally in your offline cache, unless
you hit 'reset everything,' so be careful with that one.
